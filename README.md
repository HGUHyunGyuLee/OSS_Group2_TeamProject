# Graduate Evaluator 

This is a program that evaluates students if they meet the graduation standards. Input file will be a json file that contains all the information of students such as student id, name, major, current taken semester, courses that students have taken so far, and respective grades and credits of the courses. Output of this program is whether the students are qualified to graduate as well as lacking course credits or other standards they do not satisfy (in case they are not qualified to graduate).
