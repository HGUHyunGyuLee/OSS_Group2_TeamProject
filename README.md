# Graduate Evaluator 

This is a program that evaluates students if they meet the graduation standards. Input file will be a json file that contains all the information of students such as student id, name, major, current taken semester, courses that students have taken so far, and respective grades and credits of the courses. Output of this program is whether the students are qualified to graduate as well as lacking course credits or other standards they do not satisfy (in case they are not qualified to graduate).

## Getting Started

To getstarted for this project, you should have a C language compiler. If you already have one, put the input file (.json) in the same file that your project is in. Then you are all set to run the program.

### Prerequisites

Any compilers for C languages

* for Windows XP/Vista/7/8./10
  [Code::Blocks][link]
  
  [link]: http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26
* for Ubuntu Users
  [Code::BlocksforUbuntu][link]
  
  [link]: https://launchpad.net/~damien-moore/+archive/ubuntu/codeblocks-stable
* for biginners in C languages
  [Dev-C++][link]
  
  [link]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/
* Turbo C/C++

```
Any C compilers can be utilized for this program.

```

### Installing


```
1. go to the link
2. download the compiler
3. Install
```

In case of using Terminal or other compilers

```
1. Fork the repository
2. compile the code
3. run with a name of the adequate input file(detail decription below)
```


## What does this project do?

In this project, there is an application that evaluates the students in terms of graduation standards. After setting up for the excution of the application, you write the name of an input file (.json) as CLI or as Run Configuration in your compiler.
After evaluating the student, the output will be printed.

### Why is this project useful?

Thie project is useful because you can visualize the result of graduation evaluation. This application does not simply print out the result of evaluation but shows what the evaluated student lacks as well as what the student should do more to satisfy the graduation standards.
